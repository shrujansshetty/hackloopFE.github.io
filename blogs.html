            <h2>Fake news and social media</h2>
            <p>Published on: 16/02/2024</p>
            <p>Though Social media has become almost an inevitable part of our society now, we can’t always depend on
                it. The spreading of misinformation in social media is not new. Every day we read bunches of things
                online on social media, which may happen to be true, often is not. This false or misinformation leads to
                fake news i.e. consisted of fabricated stories, without any verifiable facts, sources, or quotes. Those
                stories are forged to influence reader’s own opinions or to deceive them. The question of fake news
                refers to the point of how to think about the nature of real news. In the last few years, numbers of
                fake news stories have increased via social media platforms like What’s App, Facebook, YouTube, etc.,
                because they are shared online faster than we can ever imagine. There have been varied uses of the term
                Fake news in different reporting of news. During the second half of 2016, the term was searched
                tremendously by people shown in a Google Trends Map.

                Most of the time Fake news conflates three different notions: misinformation, disinformation, and mal
                -information. Misinformations are false information, but when a person conveys it, believes that it is
                true and shares. Disinformation is those which are shared intentionally by a person after knowing that
                it is true. On the other hand, information based on reality but imposes harm on a person, organization,
                or country is termed as mal -information. After putting all of them together, we call it fake news.</p>

            <h2>Sharing fake news</h2>
            <p>Published on: 10/02/2024</p>
            <p>Are we given enough contemplation before sharing information? Is it fake or real? Are we looking at an
                original piece of content? When and who created this content? Why is the content being shared? Why
                should we share it?

                No, usually people never give a second thought before sharing content on social media. After receiving
                content like violent video clips, images, memes, etc. people forget to verify about fake or real. It
                happens because at that moment the only thing that triggers on people’s minds is to let the people know
                about the content and its consequences. There are very few different cases with some, who inquire ” is
                the content fake?”

                However, here the problem lies with the human mind and the fake news. Our brains have a limited
                capability for processing information and for remembering, so the brain makes judgments on what to keep.
                Looking into that fact, the contents which are more familiar to people, or it has an impact on people
                due to some previous personal issues are especially shared in social media. Certainly, at that moment
                the brain can recall the previous effect of that content and without giving a second thought frequently
                passes the judgments.</p>
